                    <p>My name is Patel Urvil. I am 18 years old. Firstly, I started my learning journey with Gyan Ganga Vidhyamandir. I studied at this school for 12 years, from L.K.G. to S.S.C. After completing my 10th standard, I chose the science stream with A group (P.C.M) because I wanted to become a Computer Engineer. So, I began a new journey in science with smart work and some hard work.</p>

                    <p>I scored 93.33% in H.S.C. (P.C.M), 105 out of 120 in the Gujcet examination, and 79 PR in the first session of JEE MAIN. After realizing some mistakes, I gave my 110% in session 2 and scored 88 PR. Though I didn’t qualify for JEE ADVANCED, I am satisfied with myself. I took admission in BVM Engineering College, the oldest engineering college in Gujarat, in the Computer Engineering branch because of my interest in it.</p>

                    <p>Currently, I am studying Computer Engineering at BVM. As a beginner in this domain, I am exploring engineering and technology. I started my coding journey with Python due to its easy-to-understand syntax and readability. Python is a modern, versatile language used in ML, AI, web development, and more.</p>

                    <p>One of Python's biggest advantages is that it is object-oriented. I watch tutorials from CodeWithHarry on YouTube and have solved problems and completed small projects like a Python calculator, the Snake-Water-Gun game, and a number-guessing game. My dream project is to create AI like Jarvis. I am passionate about this because AI is the future of humanity, but it must be developed carefully. We have seen how bad AI, like Ultron in Avengers, can cause destruction. Therefore, we need to make humanized AI to improve productivity, efficiency, and learning while safeguarding humanity’s interests.</p>
